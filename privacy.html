        <h2>4. Cookies and analytics</h2>
        <p>
          We use cookies and similar technologies to remember preferences, measure performance, and improve the experience.

        <h2>5. Sharing of information</h2>
        <p>
          We do not sell your personal data. We may share limited information with trusted service providers for hosting,

        <h2>7. Security</h2>
        <p>
          We use reasonable technical and organizational safeguards to protect your data. No system is 100% secure, so we
          encourage you to use strong passwords and keep your access details private.
